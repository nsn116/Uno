AUTHORS: NALLURU NAGA SRI SUBHASH.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:  One main instruction is that the only thing to be clicked is the "void main (String[] args)" option for which you must right click the Game class.
                    Another main instruction is that you must not open any of the classes and change any data.

BASIC RULES :
                    
                    
                    The basic rules of the game are as follows :
                    
                    
                    The main objective of the game is to finish the cards in the player's hand. A player has to play a card , in his turn , which has the same colour as the top card or the same rank as the 
                    top card. If the player wishes the player can play a Wild too which allows the player to play a card of any colour he chooses and it is the player's turn again. There is another power
                    card called Wild Draw 4 which can be played by any player if he/she does not have a card with the same colour as the top card in his/her hand. If this card is played by any player,
                    the other player receives 4 cards and it is the turn of the person who played the Wild Draw 4 again. In a two player game of Uno, two other power cards called Reverse and Skip have the 
                    power of letting the person who played the respective card play again. Thus, it helps the player in trying to finish, playing the cards in his hand, faster. The last power card in any 
                    Uno game is a Draw 2 which can be played only if the top card has the same colour as the respective Draw 2 card. This power card also returns the turn to the player who played the Draw 
                    2 and deals 2 cards to the other player.
                    
                    

                    
                   
LIMITATIONS :  The game as such has no limitations. However, some limitations could be :
                
               i)   The user having to type the entire card as input.
               ii)  If the user wishes he can just type the rank followed by the colour if he/she wishes to if the card to be typed in is not a Wild Draw 4 or a Wild.
               iii) I have not played the game by passing it with all kinds of inputs so it might throw up an error. It generally should not throw up an error, though.
               iv)  The rules are printed at a very high speed in order to prevent the user from getting bored. However, the rules are printed at such a speed that the user will have to wait for output
                    that is being printed to finish being printed after which he must scroll up and look at the rules.    
               
                   
POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS : If I was given more time I would do the following :
                        
               i)   Make a better background.
               ii)  Make the program more user-friendly.
               iii) Introduce graphics into the game.
               iv)  Make the game a multiplayer game.
               v)   Reduce the number of lines of code taken to make the game by making the code more concise and straight-forward.
               vi)  Take the user's input as an index of the card in the user's hand rather than take it as a String and make the user type more (or) simply make it more convenient for the user.
